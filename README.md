# Neighborhood Map Project
This single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood. I have added functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party foursquare APIs to show data about those locations and various ways to browse the content when clicking the locations using Google Maps APIs as well as using Knockout framework.

## CAUTION:
There is a limit when calling for the foursquare api 100,000 responses per day, so please don't refresh the page too much.
